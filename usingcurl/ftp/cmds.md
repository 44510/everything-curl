# Custom FTP commands

The FTP protocol offers a wide variety of differerent commands that allow the
client to perform actions, other than the plain file transfers that curl is
focused on.

A curl user can pass on such extra (custom) commands to the server as a step
in the file transfer sequence. curl even offers to have those commands run at
different points in the process.
